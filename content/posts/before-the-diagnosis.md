I imagine every story about cancer should start when we learn we have one and how bad it is. Though I feel like I have to talk first about how it affected me and my other half, Laura, before we knew what it was.

---

My name is Clement, I am now 32 years old, but when it all started I was 30. I would say I've always been quite healthy until then, I can't remember when was the last time I had been to the doctors! I moved to the UK, from France, around 4 years before that, and I still had not registered with a [GP](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/doctors/roles-doctors/general-practitioner), mostly because of some sort of social anxiety, but also because I actually had no need for it, yet.

Before going on, I have to warn any reader that since my primary cancer is colorectal, I will mention the toilets and some unsavoury things about it. I won't go into details because there is no need and, like most people, I'm uncomfortable talking about it, but I'll still mention some things since it can give an idea of what to pay attention to if someone was worried they may have a similar problem. There will be more mention of that in this post that in any other since that's how it all started, so you can just skip this one if you'd rather not know!

At the end of 2020, I noticed a couple times some blood in the toilet bowl after using it, a bit worrying, but I didn't pay too much attention to it since it happened rarely. I also started needing the toilets more often, again, nothing too bad, but I used to have quite a precise daily routine for that (no, it wasn't intentional, just a super regular transit!), so I noticed it. I don't remember what made mention it to Laura, but she said I should go to the doctors to talk about it and see if there was anything to do to sort it out.

At that time, we were still living in the North East of England, around Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and we were also still in between [COVID lockdowns](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pdf) (or some sort of half-baked restriction system). It was quite difficult to get hold of a doctor, and required registering which lot of surgeries didn't want to do, especially because and on top of that, we were going to move to the other side of country to Portsmouth, a couple months later. I still used a (paid) service to get a phone appointment with a GP, but as expected, they couldn't do much. They recommended I talk to my GP (which I don't have yet) to potentially book a colonoscopy, I took the advice and decided I'd do something about it after moving.

A few months later, in February 2021, we move to Portsmouth by car and moving truck. The weather was terrible, which made the trip really difficult, especially for Laura who had to drive the big hired truck since I was still only used to my left-hand drive car. On top of that, I started to realise how often I had to go to the toilet on that 6+ hours trip, and that wasn't fun!

We had not found a new house to rent yet but were fortunate enough that Laura's family could welcome us in their house until we found somewhere new to call home.

A few days after the big move, I called a local surgery recommended to us (the irony, now that I know...) to register and asked for an appointment to talk about my issue. Surprisingly, I got one a few days later, but with the current COVID situation, it was phone appointments only. I mentioned everything: blood in stools/toilet, urge to go really often which ends up causing pain and not had a normal looking poo for a few months. The doctor I talked to didn't seem worried, she asked to get them a stool sample for some tests and prescribed some paracetamol for the pain.

I got the sample she asked for as soon as possible (which is not easy when you can't have a normal poo!) but never got a follow up about it. I think I called them back after a week or so and they said that they had results but everything was normal. I asked what was the next step but apparently there was none planned...?
I started questioning myself, thinking maybe it's all in my head since the doctor is not worried and would only prescribe paracetamol, but when you have to go that often to the toilet, it's hard to think everything is normal, especially when you live in someone else's house full of other people!
A few month or so later, since nothing improved, I contacted the doctors again, describing the same symptoms but even worse. Another phone appointment, another stool test, another prescription, this time with an ointment to help with the pain, their new hypothesis is that it's just hemorroids, but that it also could be [IBS, IBD or  more specifically Crohn's disease](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/what-is-ibd/ibs-vs-ibd). They referred me for a colonoscopy to check for these, that was probably around April at that point.

Since the doctors were clearly not doing to do much more, and that my condition was not improving, we tried things which could help with IBS. Laura was incredibly supportive and was doing her best to make it easier for me, including helping me follow a super strict diet to try and find if anything in particular was triggering my problems. It's called a [low FODMAP Diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-fodmap-diet) and you basically remove everything which could trigger IBS symptoms for a while, and then you reintroduce them type by type to see which one seems to be triggering symptoms. With Laura's help, we did that for a while, and though sometimes it felt like it helped, it really didn't change much. Still blood, still a lot of pain, still impossible to live a normal life.

I forgot the exact timeline of what happened after, but as life became less and less bearable - I know it sounds like nothing, but having to run to the toilets every hour and stay in there in pain for 30 minutes is really rough -, Laura ended up being the one calling the doctors for me, as I didn't believe they would do anything. They eventually gave up and booked me for an in-person appointment with the same GP, which was as useless as the phone calls. While in the waiting room, I could even hear her from her office complaining that I was here and that I should just have gotten a phone appointment. Felt really welcome!

To be honest, yes it should have been on the phone, because she didn't do anything, she got me to sit on a chair, and just talked to me. I mentioned again the blood, the toilets, and losing around 10kg in the past 5 months because I'm scared of eating, since it triggers even more the need for the toilets. She checked that I was indeed referred for a colonoscopy, for which I still had not had any news for in June as far as I can remember. She told me to take paracetamol and sent me home (she might have again asked for me to send her my poo I forgot, but again, normal results , I think she must have a kink or something). They also said that they couldn't give me anything else which may help with IBS since they weren't sure it was that and needed the colonoscopy for it.

In June, after months of searching and switching before trying to buy a house or to rent a house, we finally found somewhere to rent, just for us! It was a massive relief, even though Laura's family is amazing, and let us stay in a house next door for months, we really needed to have our own home.

---

Again, I am not completed sure of when this specific thing happened, but I know it's after moving to our new house, and before the end of July, but I finally got my appointment for a colonoscopy! While I was obviously not looking forward to the procedure itself (in England, they don't use anaesthetic or sedation for it...), I was hoping that the results would mean I could finally get a treatment and get better!

So, the way it was supposed to go is that, for instance, I had the procedure on a Thursday, and a call with a nurse on a Monday to talk about the procedure and answer usual medical questions. However, for some reason, the call with the nurse got planned on the Tuesday instead, and quite late during the day. I got the call, answered all the questions, everything was fine though I mentioned I was stressing out about getting a camera up my butt, but who doesn't. Eventually she asked if I did a COVID test (which wasn't mentioned anywhere before), I said no but I can definitely have one now. She says it as to be one done at the hospital, and it has to be 48 hours before the procedure. Wait, 48 hours...? We are already less than 48 hours to the time! That wouldn't have been a problem if they called 3 days before as normal, but instead the result was that they cancelled the procedure, and there were not booking any other one yet. Yes, it does sound absolutely crazy, especially after that long of a wait, but it happened exactly like that. I wish I was exaggerating but no.

I'm quite a chill person, so I was only really disappointed, and kind of giving up of getting any help at that point, but Laura was furious! What can we do though? We can't kidnap a doctor to put that camera where it shouldn't be.

The new house was quite far from the GP surgery, and since we clearly had a bad experience with it, we decided to register to the nearest one.

Around mid-July, as the situation was still getting worse every day, I asked for an appointment at the new GP, and got one quite quickly. The doctor there was great, she listened to me, was quite surprised nothing had happened yet to get more information, made sure I was still referred for a colonoscopy, and checked my vitals. She also asked if she could check my tummy and various usual doctor things. For the very first time, I felt like a doctor was paying attention to my problems and really wanted to help. Thinking about it now actually makes me feel emotional. It was so hard to simply get to that point. She also took some blood for a test (I will talk about my phobia of needles and blood another time...). She also said that if I was again in a lot of pain and going that often to the toilet - which obviously was going to happen since it's been now getting worse and worse for more than 6 months - I had to go to A&E (Hospital Emergencies' name in the UK).

---

The next day was one of the worse I had so I listened to her advice, and went to the hospital. It took forever for someone to see me, and they basically sent me in a bed in some ward with lot of light, beeping noise, and people coming in and out with additional puking noise, groaning or snoring. What a lovely place, I was glad I came.

I waited for hours in there, and finally saw a doctor at around 1:00 in the morning. I told them my symptoms and the whole story you just read, and it really annoyed them that it took so long to do anything. He was a young doctor, but seemed to really want to help, he knew that they had to figure out something because I wasn't living my life, I was just surviving it and nothing about it was normal. They gave me fluids through IV and some sleeping pills as they couldn't do much just now. They wanted me to see a gastroenterologist in the morning to hopefully expedite the colonoscopy and also get a CT scan.
After a night and another day of constant beeping (I didn't know at the time how often I would hear that beep in the next couple years) and waiting, I saw another doctor in the evening but since it was Saturday they couldn't do anything else before Monday. I've asked to be discharged since I couldn't really get any rest, and I would be happier home with Laura and Okanee (our lovely dog!) and with easy access to my own toilets.
They prescribed some more painkiller, which actually helped (Cocodamol) and let me go home.

Luckily after that, things started to move quicker, I got a CT scan the next week. If you don't know what it is, I'll try to explain. The machine itself is a sort of big donut. You lie down on a table, and the table move back and forth through the donut hole. Sometimes you have to follow breathing instructions like holding your breath for a few seconds, sometimes (always in my case, so maybe it's always the case) you get a cannula to inject some contrast fluid in your system. That's to help seeing things on the scan. The whole thing takes maybe 5 minutes maximum, and the contrast fluid makes you feel like you need to pee but you don't and the feeling goes away really quickly anyway.

After that, I didn't really know what to expect next, didn't really care about that scan since everyone said that the only thing that mattered and which would get me help was a colonoscopy, but in the end, it's that specific scan which started everything.

But that ominous sounding meeting is for another post as this one is started to be a bit long!

In the end, I am not sure what was worse, feeling that unwell and not knowing, or knowing and having to deal with all the treatments I need. Of course it's quite likely I wouldn't be there to write about it if we never knew so the answer should be simple!
